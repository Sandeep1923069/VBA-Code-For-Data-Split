# VBA-Code-For-Data-Split
HI,

I made a VBA code to split data on the basis of column number in excel. You have to just download the file and click on the button and select the file from which you want to split data after that just enter the column number on the basis of that your data will split. A folder is created on desktop with data_split name and in that folder there will be multiple subfolder According to the name mention in column number.

for example.

I have huge sales data in excel. there are multiple columns and rows and I want to split data on city basis or region basis. I need to just open this master code file and click on the button and select the file and enter the column number in which city or region mention and press enter, Boom! your data is split a file is created om desktop
